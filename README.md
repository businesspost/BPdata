**Business Post Excess Mortality Study**

This repository contains excess mortality data analysed by Business Post Data on 12/06/2020 for the purposes of comparing the excess mortality rate in 18 different European countries to Ireland, during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.

**Source**
The data was sourced from the Human Mortality Database: https://www.mortality.org/ - avaiable under 'hmd_data_downloaded_11_06.xisx' and from independent research by University College, Cork economist Seamus Coffey.

**Method**
All of the data can be found in the file Excess_deaths_IE.xisx.

The 'overview' tab breaks down the calculations for excess mortality rates based on the excess death toll for each country.

The breakdown for each country is available under the remaining tabs where the weekly number of deaths were averaged for the previous four to five years and subtracted from this years deaths in order to calcualte weekly excess. 

The total excess was then calculated for the period of week 8 to 18 (weeks ending February 23 to May 3) where possible and subsequently filtered and totalled. The use of a standard interval for comparison (as well as the conversion to 0 of negative values) was implemented on the advice of Vladimir Shkolnikov, Director of the Human Mortality Database. A standard timeframe allows for the fairest comparison across country due to the completeness of the deaths data for that period.

The number for Ireland was provided based on estimates by University College, Cork professor of economics Seamus Coffey, who has carried out an analysis of the number of obituary postings by funeral undertakers to the website RIP.ie - considered the best available source of public data on deaths in real-time in Ireland and credited as being within 1 per cent of the official deaths registered to the CSO in previous years.

The 'excess deaths mortality death rate' per million was calculated with 2020 population data estimated in the 2019 Revision of World Population Prospects (2020 median estimates) available here:

Data was compared to similar analysis carried out by the New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html, the Financial Times https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/ and the Economist https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries
